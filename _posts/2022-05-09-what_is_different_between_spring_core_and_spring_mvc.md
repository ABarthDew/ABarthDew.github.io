**Spring Core:** Spring Core, also known as the Spring Framework, is the foundation of the Spring ecosystem. It provides the basic infrastructure and features for building enterprise-level Java applications, such as dependency injection, inversion of control, and aspect-oriented programming. Spring Core provides a lightweight container for managing Java objects and their dependencies, making it easier to develop and maintain complex applications.

**Spring MVC:** Spring MVC is a web application framework built on top of Spring Core. It provides a model-view-controller architecture for building web applications, with support for handling HTTP requests and responses, rendering views, and managing the application flow. Spring MVC is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to easily add custom features and functionality to their applications.

In summary, while Spring Core provides the foundation for building enterprise-level Java applications, Spring MVC provides a web application framework for building web applications. Spring MVC is built on top of Spring Core and provides additional features and functionality for handling HTTP requests and responses and managing the application flow in a web application.
