`Vue 3` is the latest version of the Vue.js framework and comes with several new features and improvements over ***Vue 2***. Some of the major differences between ***Vue 2*** and `Vue 3` are:

**1. Improved Performance:** `Vue 3` has a new rendering engine called "Compiler 2.0" which is designed to generate faster and smaller bundle sizes. `Vue 3` also has a new reactive system that reduces the amount of boilerplate code and provides better performance for larger applications.

**2. Composition API:** `Vue 3` introduces a new way to organize code called the "Composition API". It allows developers to write reusable code using functions and makes it easier to share logic between components. This is a significant improvement over the "Options API" used in ***Vue 2***.

**3. Smaller Bundle Size:** `Vue 3` comes with a smaller bundle size due to better tree-shaking capabilities and modular architecture.

**4. New Features:** `Vue 3` has several new features such as Fragments, Teleport, and Suspense that make it easier to build complex user interfaces.

**5. TypeScript Support:** `Vue 3` has better TypeScript support, making it easier for developers to write type-safe code.

**6. Custom Renderer:** `Vue 3` introduces a new API for custom renderers, making it easier to build custom rendering engines and integrate Vue with other frameworks.

Overall, `Vue 3` is a significant improvement over ***Vue 2***, with better performance, a new composition API, smaller bundle size, and several new features. However, it may require some changes to your existing codebase to upgrade from ***Vue 2*** to `Vue 3`.
